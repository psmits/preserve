\section{Introduction}

% latitudinal diversity gradients
%   hypotheses as to why, in terms of diversification
% diversity dependence
%   as population size increases, speciation decreases and/or extinction increases
%   the idea that there are ``ecological limits'' on biodiversity
%     limiting similarity/competitive exclusion
%       similarity in ecology/niche due to high phylogenetic similarity 
%     resources
%     space
%   see Harmon vs Rabosky debate in AmNat
%   seen as sign of ``biological interaction''
%     probably more complicated than that, as nothing is A or B but rather A and B.


% Phanerozoic brachiopods
%   gain, loss, gain, etc. LDG
%   what is knowledge of the field?


% Biogeographic regions
%   taxa can leave provinces/be extirpated
%     they can also then return!
%     complicated by not knowing what to attribute an ``absence'' to
%       sampling versus reality
%     have to average over the record to detect actual absences
%       latent/hidden state
%   capture-mark-recapture, Foote/Alroy rates, PyRate can't do this
%   instead, have to model as occupancy!
%     in comes the HMM model
