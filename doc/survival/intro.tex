\section{Introduction}

How do differences in taxon traits effect differences in extinction risk? \citet{Jablonski1987} hypothesizes that as baseline extinction risk increases, the importance of taxon traits, such as ecology or environmental preference, should decrease in importance. The trait where this pattern should be weakest in terms of magnitude is geographic range \citep{Jablonski1987}. This hypothesis has strong implications for any model of extinction risk: the effect of taxon traits should decrease when baseline extinction intensity increases. This can be stated in a discrete background versus mass extinction framework \citep{Jablonski1987} or a continuous rate variation framework \citep{Wang2003}.% I favor the continuous framework as this hypothesis and prediction are then redly translated into a generalized linear model (GLM) of taxon survival.

Geographic range is widely considered the most important taxon trait for estimating differences extinction risk at nearly all times \citep{Jablonski1986,Jablonski1987,Jablonski2003,Payne2007}. This is logical because if mortality is randomly distributed spatially, a taxon with a large geographic range is less likely to be completely wiped out than a taxon with restricted range. This is a strong prediction based on strong prior evidence.

\citet{Miller2009a} demonstrated that, during mass extinctions, taxa which are associated with open ocean environments have a greater extinction risk than those taxa that favor epicontinental seas. During periods of background extinction, however, they found no consistent difference between taxa favoring either environment. Because of this study, the following prediction for survival patterns can be made: as extinction risk increases, taxa associated with open ocean environments should generally increase in extinction risk.

Of additional interest is the possibility of a potential nonlinear relationship between environmental preference and taxon duration. A long standing hypothesis is that generalists or unspecialized taxa will have greater survival than specialists \citep{Simpson1944,Liow2004a,Nurnberg2013a,Nurnberg2015,Baumiller1993} \uppercase{Smits, in prep}. A simple expectation for continuous traits is that this nonlinearity would manifest as a downward facing function, with taxa with intermediate trait values having a greater expected durations than taxa with high or low trait values. By utilizing a continuous measure of environmental preference, it is relatively straight forward to allow for this non-linearity.

I adopt a hierarchical Bayesian survival modelling approach for multiple reasons, one being that it represents a conceptual and statistical unification of the paleontological dynamic and cohort survivorship approaches \citep{VanValen1973,VanValen1979,Raup1978,Raup1975,Foote1988,Baumiller1993,Simpson2006}. In this case, origination cohorts are the groups and the mean survival model corresponds to the dynamic survivorship model. By using a Bayesian framework I am best able to quantify the uncertainty inherent in the estimates of the effects of taxon traits on survival especially in cases where the covariates of interest (species traits) are themselves known with error.

Hierarchical modelling, sometimes called ``mixed-effects modeling,'' is a statistical approach which explicitly takes into account the structure of the observed data in order to model both the with and between group structure \citep{Gelman2013d,Gelman2007}. In this approach, the units of study (e.g. genera) belong to a single grouping (e.g. origination cohort) that are also considered draws from a probability distribution (e.g. all cohorts, observed and unobserved). The degree of similarity between the groups is then estimated simultaneously as the other parameters of interest (e.g. covariate effects) \citep{Gelman2013d}. The subsequent estimates are then partially pooled together, where parameters from groups with large samples or effects are allowed to be far away from the overall group mean while those for groups with small samples or effects are pulled towards the overall group mean.

This partial pooling is one of the greatest advantages of hierarchical modeling. By letting the groups ``support'' each other, parameter estimates much better reflect our uncertainty in their estimates. Additionally, this partial pooling helps control for multiple comparisons and spurious results as small effects with little empirical support are drawn towards the overall group mean \citep{Gelman2013d,Gelman2007}. This means that while estimates for an individual group may be weakly constrained, all groups contribute to the weighted average that is the overall group mean.

In this analysis, genera are structured as belonging to origination cohorts. All covariate effects (regression coefficients), as well as the intercept term, were allowed to vary by group. The covariance/correlation between covariate effects was also modeled. This hierarchical structure allows inference for how covariates effects may change with respect to each other while simultaneously estimating the effects themselves, correctly propagating our uncertainty. Additionally, instead of relying on potentially biased point estimates of environmental affinity, I adopt a measurement error model approach where environmental affinity is measured as the difference in the taxon's environmental occurrence pattern and the background environmental occurrence pattern. This approach too correctly propagates our uncertainty, which leads to more valid posterior inference.
